# Terraform AWS Project

## Description

This project creates a scalable AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It includes:

- An S3 bucket for Terraform state management.
- A VPC and EC2 instance with security configurations.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- Terraform CLI installed.
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.

## Steps

1. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
2. Plan the deployment: `terraform plan`
3. Apply the deployment: `terraform apply`

## Files

- `main.tf`: Main configuration.
- `variables.tf`: Variable definitions.
- `terraform.tfvars`: Variable values.
- `backend.tf`: Backend configuration.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Notes

- Ensure `terraform.tfvars` is excluded from version control (e.g., using `.gitignore`).
- Review security groups for production use to avoid exposing resources unnecessarily.
